                The Nigeria Association of Computing Students (NACOS) was established in July 1993 by a consortium of students under the name Nigeria Association of Computer Science Students (NACOSS), with the endorsement of the Nigeria Computer Society (NCS) as its parent organization. NACOS serves as a platform for students engaged in various IT-related fields to collectively address and advocate for issues of interest in a coordinated and structured manner. <br>NACOSites, referring to its members, are students pursuing tertiary education in computer-related disciplines such as Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Information Technology. Each member is affiliated with the Association's local chapter within their respective institutions.
